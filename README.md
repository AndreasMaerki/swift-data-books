# SwiftUI Book Explorer with SwiftData

BooksApp is a simple iOS app that explores how to work with SwiftData, the successor of CoreData, in a SwiftUI application. The app allows users to browse, add, edit and delete books as well as view book details.

This app is a work in progress. More functionality will be added.
